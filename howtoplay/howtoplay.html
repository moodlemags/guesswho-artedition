        <h2> Thanks for playing Guess Who: Artist Edition!! </h2>
        <p> Here are the rules for playing: </p>
        <p>As you may have noticed, you have already been dealt a mystery painting card. Your goal in this game is to guess who the artist of this painting is by eliminating all of the other artists. At the start of each round you will be prompted to guess an attribute. If your artist has this attribute, nothing will happen to the artists on the board but you will have an important piece of information! If your artist does not have this attribute, then all artists with such attribute will disappear. You will have 5 rounds in which to guess your artist, although if you know before 5 rounds are up feel free to click on your guess and see if you're right! Points are scored by how few turns it takes you to guess your artist plus an additional 10 pts if you guess correctly. After you've finished it is your opponents turn to play!</p>
