# Welcome to GuessWho: Art Edition!

#### The why --
The game(s) that I built were focused on a huge lack in a niche market that I've noticed over my academic/professional career, which is a resource for learning and studying art history. For this game, I decided to be inspired by my love of art and the board game Guess Who.
