<!-- GUESS WHO WITH ARTISTS & PAINTINGS

html aspects:
1) build out a grid of divs holding images that are 5x5
2) create start buttons/skip turn/nav bar long side

js:
1) the two games are interactive so first prompt for which game to load, memory/trivia or guess who
2) load the style
3) have a randomly selected painting load as User 1's mystery card
4) prompt user to guess a quality about the artist who painted it
5) gray out any artists guessed
6) user can either get 5 guesses or can click on an artist to guess
7) at end of turn, logs the score for P1 and randomly selects a painting for player 2

QUESTIONS:
- integrating images & objects, or is it best to stick with an array --> object key image and value link works
- how to randomly select non-integers, or should I have the paintings be correlated w/ an ID # that is generated -- array of objects and then shuffle the object and that array # is the random


TRIVIA OR MEMORY WITH SAME ARRAY OF ARTISTS AND PAINTINGS
