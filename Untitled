1) provide the mystery image that user has to find the artist of



have an object of attributes w/ matching values of artist names
- if an attribute is guessed then shade out the images w/ the class of the artist name
step one: Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(attributeSearch, "key"); (will return T or F)
  --> if (^ is true) {print the names of the artists it's true about}
step two: prompt - print the artists who have the attribute
--> use this to print dead key-artists names
                          var buz = {
                          fog: 'stack'
                        };

                        for (var name in buz) {
                          if (buz.hasOwnProperty(name)) {
                            console.log('this is fog (' + name + ') for sure. Value: ' + buz[name]);
                          }
                          else {
                            console.log(name); // toString or something else
                          }
                        }
step three: use dom stuff to find those w/ classes of the same and shade out
